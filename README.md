# SM64 Randomizer Tracker

Track what warps point to where and how many stars you need for each door for [Arthurtilly's new SM64 Randomizer (v0.2)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZlx3kACdwXH1G58ffzn7_g). Left or right click the level images to cycle, and click the number next to the stars under the doors to edit the value. 

This was coded using some very basic jQuery. Nothing fancy.
